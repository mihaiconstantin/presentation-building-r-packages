> Here we will add instructions for how people can use the repository.


Main files and folders of interest: 
- [`content/presentation/Presentation.vue`](content/presentation/Presentation.vue)
- [`content/presentation/slides/`](content/presentation/slides)
- [`content/handout/`](content/handout)
- [`content/abstract/`](content/abstract)

**The slides need to be served via the `http` protocol** (e.g., a simple local web server would do). 

For example, `python -m SimpleHTTPServer -p 8000` and presentation will be up at `http://localhost:8000`.
